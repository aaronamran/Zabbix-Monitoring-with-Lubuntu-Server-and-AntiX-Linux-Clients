# Zabbix Monitoring with Lubuntu Server and antiX Linux Clients

This write-up documents a practical monitoring project using VirtualBox to simulate a lightweight infrastructure monitoring environment with Zabbix. A Lubuntu VM is configured as the Zabbix server, while antiX Linux VMs act as monitored clients. This setup demonstrates how to efficiently monitor system resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk) in a minimal-resource lab, ideal for single-laptop environments. The focus is on setting up agent-based monitoring, configuring basic alerts, and optimizing performance without relying on heavy operating systems or cloud infrastructure. The antiX Linux VM setup in VirtualBox is included at the beginning of this write-up, while the initial Lubuntu VM setup in VirtualBox is not included as it was completed beforehand.
